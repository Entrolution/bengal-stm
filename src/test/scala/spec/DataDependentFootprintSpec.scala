/** H6 — DATA-DEPENDENT FOOTPRINT DIVERGENCE, behaviourally.
  *
  * The TLA+ model (specs/commit/CommitH6.cfg) shows that a transaction scheduled on a footprint that names the WRONG
  * IDS breaks serializability by exactly the H3 mechanism — reads are never commit-validated and hold no lock, so the
  * scheduler is the only defence, and it cannot defend against a footprint that does not describe the transaction.
  *
  * This suite shows the same thing on the shipped code, and DETERMINISTICALLY rather than by racing a microsecond
  * window. The lever is that `staticAnalysisCompiler` executes `TxnDelay` thunks — so `STM[F].fromF` lets the test
  * suspend the ANALYSIS pass itself, mid-flight, and act while it is parked.
  *
  * The mechanism, step by step:
  *
  *   1. `analysis` reads kv1/kv2 — the key SOURCES — and parks on `analysisGate`. It has already decided it will touch
  *      map entries "c" and "d".
  *   2. With it parked, the test flips kv1 := "a", kv2 := "b". The transaction is NOT yet in `activeTransactions` (it
  *      has not been submitted — the analysis has not returned), so nothing serializes the flip against it. This is the
  *      gap: TxnRuntime.commit runs the walker BEFORE submitTxn, outside any Contract-C window.
  *   3. The analysis resumes and declares reads of entries "c" and "d". That footprint is now simply WRONG, and NOTHING
  *      THREW — so the H3 under-approximation flag never fires and the scheduler trusts it.
  *   4. The real log run reads kv1/kv2 again, gets "a"/"b", and touches entries "a" and "b" — which the scheduler never
  *      knew about, and which it therefore never protected.
  *   5. A `transfer` transaction (which moves 1 from entry "a" to entry "b", so a+b is invariantly 0) is judged
  *      COMPATIBLE with the declared footprint, because that footprint mentions "c" and "d". It runs concurrently and
  *      commits between the reader's two reads.
  *   6. The reader observes a TORN transfer: entry "a" from before it, entry "b" from after. It sums to 1. No serial
  *      order produces that, because a + b is 0 in every state.
